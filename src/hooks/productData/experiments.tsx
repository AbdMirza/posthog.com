Run experiments on funnels to see the impact of a change on a aggregate values or a series of events, like a signup flow. You can track up to nine metrics to see how your experiment affects other parts of your app or different flows. Our Bayesian statistical engine gives you results anytime without p-hacking concerns. You'll get clear win probabilities that let you make confident decisions when you have data to back it up, not when you hit some arbitrary date.",

            '<strong>Experiments:</strong> Pick a metric. Test funnels, clicks, revenue, whatever. Add secondary metrics to catch side effects (like signups up but activation down).<br /><br /><strong>Statistical analysis:</strong> Check results day 1, day 3, or day 30 - it won\'t mess up your stats. (Other tools punish you for "peeking".) We let <em>you</em> decide when you have enough evidence.<br /><br /><strong>Bayesian statistical engine:</strong> You can make better data decisions with statistically-significant probability. For example, "95% probability on variant B is better by 5-10%" vs. not null hypothesis rejection nonsense. See the likely impact range so you can weigh improvement vs implementation cost.<br /><br /><strong>Flexible experiment types:</strong> Test anything - conversion rates, average order value, session time, feature depth. Shared metrics library means define once, use them across PostHog.<br /><br /><strong>Smart recommendations:</strong> We analyze your data and give you accurate predictions: "5% improvement with high variance? 6 weeks." "50% improvement on stable metric? 1 week." It also catches sample ratio mismatch (ie: your randomization is broken).<br /><br /><strong>Advanced targeting:</strong> For example, test pricing for US users who joined after Jan 1st. Or enterprise features for 100+ employee companies. B2B? Run group-level experiments so everyone at a company sees the same thing.<br /><br /><strong>Developer-friendly implementation:</strong> Every experiment is just a feature flag but with a powerful engine on top. Same SDKs, same infrastructure. Local evaluation, bootstrapping, JSON payloads - all included.',

        // "These questions reflect real decisions teams face every day. Testing a new onboarding flow? Set up a funnel experiment measuring completion rates. Geographic differences matterâ€”our automatic IP resolution lets you analyze results by region without manual setup. For B2B products, group-level experiments ensure everyone at a company sees the same experience, avoiding the confusion of user-level randomization. Revenue experiments need special careâ€”make sure you're tracking the full customer journey, not just the purchase event. And yes, you should test that social proofâ€”we've seen it increase conversions by 20-40% for many teams.",
        pricing:
            'Experiments are billed as feature flag requests since that\'s what they are under the hood. You get 1 million requests free per month, then pay-as-you-go after that. This is radically different from tools like Optimizely that can run 5-figures annually for experimentation. With PostHog, a typical B2C app running 5-10 experiments might use 10-20 million requests per month. That\'s a few hundred dollars, not tens of thousands. And you get all featuresâ€”no "enterprise" tier needed for basic functionality like API access or custom metrics. And the best part: get it all without "jumping on a quick call with sales!"',
        'comparison-summary':
            "The experimentation landscape has three camps: dedicated tools like Optimizely, analytics add-ons like Amplitude, and integrated platforms like PostHog. Optimizely is powerful but expensive and complex. Amplitude requires you to already use Amplitude. PostHog gives you experimentation as part of a complete platform. Our Bayesian engine is genuinely differentiated â€“ most tools still use frequentist statistics that don't let you check results early. We also uniquely support group-level experiments for B2B products and integrate deeply with session replay for qualitative insights.",
        'feature-comparison':
            "This comparison highlights our unique strengths. PostHog Experiments is the only tool that lets you check results anytime without statistical penalties â€“ a huge advantage for fast-moving teams. Group-level experiments are exclusive to PostHog, critical for B2B products. The integrated session replay means you can watch users in each variant to understand the 'why' behind the numbers. Our shared metrics library ensures consistency across experiments.<br /><br /><strong>What we don't have:</strong> no-code visual editor (yet!) or CMS capabilities. You'll need engineering resources to implement tests, but that's a deliberate choice as we're building for technical teams who want power and flexibility.",
        docs: "Our experimentation docs go deep into the statistical methodology because we believe you should understand the tools you're using. We explain Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches, sequential testing, and why we've made certain choices. But we also keep it practical with guides on common patterns: testing pricing changes, optimizing onboarding funnels, and measuring long-term impact. The docs include power calculators, sample size estimators, and templates for experiment design. We're transparent about limitations too â€“ like why you shouldn't run experiments on metrics with extreme outliers without transformation.",
        'pairs-with':
            "PostHog Experiments truly shine when combined with our other products. Start with an experiment on a new feature, then use product analytics to dive deeper than your primary metricâ€”maybe conversion increased but time-to-convert also increased. Watch session recordings of users in each variant to see exactly how they interact differently. If the experiment wins, roll it out gradually using the same feature flag. This integrated workflow means you're not jumping between tools or trying to match user IDs across systems. It's one platform where everything connects.",
        'getting-started':
            "If you don't have a ton of experience running tests, here's an idea to get you going: your first experiment should be something simple with a clear metric. Maybe test a new button color (yes, they can matter especially at scale in B2C apps) or headline text. Create the experiment, which automatically creates a feature flag. Implement the flag check in your code â€“ usually 5-10 lines (and AI is really good at helping with this!). Launch to 50% of users and within days, you'll see initial results with probability estimates.<br /><br />The key is starting simple and building confidence. Once you see how easy it is, you'll naturally progress to more complex experiments. Before long, you'll be testing everything, and your metrics (and investors) will thank you for it.",
