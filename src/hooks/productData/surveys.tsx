        features:
            "<strong>Question types:</strong> All the standards: multiple choice, ratings, emojis, free text. Plus embedded links - great for calendly scheduling or external forms.<br /><br /><strong>Templates:</strong> NPS, PMF, satisfaction, user interviews. Start from these or build your own. Takes minutes.<br /><br /><strong>Display conditions:</strong> Target by URL, user properties, or feature flags. Ask beta users about new features. Survey only enterprise customers. Whatever you need.<br /><br /><strong>Multi-step surveys:</strong> Up to 10 questions. Progress bar included. People actually complete multi-step surveys when they're contextual.<br /><br /><strong>Link somewhere:</strong> End with a calendar link for user interviews. Or send to a detailed feedback form. Mix in-app and external collection.<br /><br /><strong>No-code and API:</strong> Visual builder for most cases. API when you need custom UI or complex logic. Both use the same backend.<br /><br /><strong>More features:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Aggregated results:</strong> See response distributions, average scores, trends over time.<br /><br /><strong>Slack notifications:</strong> Get responses in real-time. Great for catching urgent feedback.<br /><br /><strong>Customizable wait periods:</strong> Don't annoy new users. Set delays before showing surveys.",
