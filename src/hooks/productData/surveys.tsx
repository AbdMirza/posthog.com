Start from a template or build your own from scratch.<br /><br /><strong>Display conditions:</strong> Target by URL, user properties, or feature flags. You can ask beta users about new features or survey only enterprise customers.<br /><br /><strong>Multi-step surveys:</strong> Up to 10 questions, progress bar included.<br /><br /><strong>Link somewhere:</strong> End with a calendar link for user interviews or send to a detailed feedback form. Mix in-app and external collection.<br /><br /><strong>No-code and API:</strong> Visual builder for most cases and an API when you need custom UI or complex logic â€“ both use the same backend.<br /><br /><strong>More features:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Aggregated results:</strong> See response distributions, average scores, trends over time.<br /><br /><strong>Slack notifications:</strong> Get responses in real-time â€“ great for catching urgent feedback.<br /><br /><strong>Customizable wait periods:</strong> Avoid annoying users new users â€“ set delays before showing surveys so you trigger at the right time.",

            'These are actual survey questions our customers use. User interviews? End with a Calendly link. PMF survey? Use the template. Support satisfaction? Time it after ticket resolution. The key is asking at the right moment - after they use a feature, complete a task, or hit a milestone.',
        pricing:
            "Use surveys free, or enter a credit card for advanced features. Either way, your first 250 survey responses are free â€“ every month, then it's simple usage-based pricing. No limits on surveys created or questions asked. Compare that to SurveyMonkey charging $99/month for basic features. We include everything â€“ targeting, multi-step, API access â€“ out of the box.",
        'comparison-summary':
            "Traditional survey tools (SurveyMonkey, Typeform) are disconnected from your product. Modern tools (Pendo, Sprig) are expensive and still siloed. We built surveys into the platform, so responses connect to user data, sessions, and analytics. (We're the only one with feature flag targeting.)",
        'feature-comparison':
            "We have all the core features. What we don't have: AI analysis (yet) or complex form logic. But we uniquely support feature flag targeting - survey only users who have a specific feature enabled. Nobody else does that.",
        docs: "We've got clear setup guides for both no-code and API approaches with real-world examples of different survey types and when to use them. Common patterns like NPS calculation and user interview scheduling are documented with copy-paste examples.",
        'pairs-with':
            "Survey someone, then watch their session to see what they were doing. Run analytics on survey responses segmented by user properties. Target surveys to users with specific feature flags enabled. This integration is why response rates are so high - you're asking the right people at the right time.",
        'getting-started':
            "Build a survey in minutes: pick a template, customize the questions, set targeting rules. You'll start seeing responses immediately. The hardest part is deciding what to ask. Not sure where to start? Go simple: ask one question about the feature they just used. You can always iterate from there!",
