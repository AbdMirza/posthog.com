            analyze all your product and customer data in PostHog ‚Äì no matter where it was generated.

          <p>
            PostHog's CDP is built for product engineers who want to understand how product usage correlates with business data generated elsewhere. you can get it all into PostHog, then send it wherever else you need it to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            we've got warehouse sources, event pipelines, transformations, realtime event streaming, batch exports ‚Äì it's all here, whether you call it a CDP, ETL, a data warehouse, event pipelines, or another ambiguous industry term.

          <h3>ü™¶ RIP the modern data stack</h3>

          <p>it was a great idea, but as the stage of your company changes, the ‚Äúmodern data stack‚Äù inevitably devolves into a complicated mess of tools and integrations.</p>

          <p><strong>what‚Äôs worse:</strong> it usually means hiring someone to manage it all ‚Äì and at that point, the data becomes less accessible to the product engineers and product managers responsible for building products.</p>

          <blockquote>
            if you‚Äôre interested in reading more about how we feel about the modern data stack, read our <em>definitely not-opinionated</em> blog post on it: <Link to="/blog/modern-data-stack-sucks" state={{ newWindow: true }}>The modern data stack sucks <IconArrowUpRight className="size-4 inline-block" /> </Link>
          </blockquote>

          <p>so what if it didn‚Äôt have to be this way?</p>

          <p>that‚Äôs the idea with PostHog‚Äôs customer data platform. everything can finally live in one place, and can be analyzed with any of PostHog‚Äôs insight tools or BI visualizations. it doesn‚Äôt require a data engineer, and it scales with you as you grow.</p>

          <p>a customer data platform is not just event pipelines and destinations. it‚Äôs not a regurgitated feed of user activity. it‚Äôs not just a SQL editor and some transformations.</p>

          <p>a true CDP is when you combine an ETL solution, event pipelines, modeling, data exporting and realtime event streaming, *and* a way to analyze and visualize it (insights, product analytics, BI) ‚Äì all in a single place.</p>

          <p>our CDP is specifically built with the needs of product engineers in mind ‚Äì to help you get the data points you need to build success products ‚Äì without having to hire a dedicated team to handle it all.</p>

          <h3>roadmap</h3>
          <p>PostHog is always a work in progress. here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre working on next, and what we‚Äôre thinking about building soon:</p>
