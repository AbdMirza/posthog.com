# AI code editing, prompt guardrails, and syntax

- Always check for any code changes in files you've edited before making further edits. I often make changes to files in between prompts and don't want my changes to get overwritten.
- Assume user may have manually changed the file mid-flow
- Always use double quotes (unless something different is necessated by content)
- Always use sentence casing, even when writing internal documentation in Markdown
- Add a `README.md` file for large, structural changes or new features
