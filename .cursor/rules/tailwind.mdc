# Don't add new Tailwind styles and don't use stock colors

- Check [tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js) for supported colors.

There are two color modes (light and dark) and three color schemes within each:

- primary (main content)
- secondary (aside content)
- tertiary (not used often)

Classes should use:

- bg-primary
- bg-accent
- border-primary
- border-input
- text-primary
- text-secondary
- text-muted
- text-input

Use inline Tailwind classes wherever possible. Any custom CSS should be added to [global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css) and use @apply where possible. Then use JIT classes, then regular css but nested where possible.

Links are styled with font-semibold and use different colors for light and dark mode:

- text-right
- dark:text-yellow
