# Don't add new Tailwind styles and don't use stock colors

- Check [tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js) for supported colors.

There are two color modes (light and dark) and three color schemes within each:

- primary (main content)
- secondary (aside content)
- tertiary (not used often)

Links are styled with font-semibold and use different colors for light and dark mode:

- text-right
- dark:text-yellow
