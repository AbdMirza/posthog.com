Subheading for email: "Congratulations, you're the bottleneck"

another meme idea: hedgehog version of this - https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5610AQFPrI1pRqqgFA/image-shrink_800/image-shrink_800/0/1728154838097?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=H6AEd1utCpJBY8lhwhljSyUBW1LVO98uFZaCErRsJx4 

<intro>

maybe bits on how this is intented for anyone who leads eng teams (ICs) and not just managers

## 1. You became the bottleneck/gatekeeper (alt: You slow your team down, not speed them up)

Bits on hoarding context and acting like the teams gatekeeper/router. Bring the context to your team

Maybe some overlap from the PM newsletter section 1 on not controlling engineers - https://posthog.com/newsletter/product-management-is-broken#1-pms-dont-control-engineers

Dont try become the sole point of communication between your team and others. Instead, connect the right people together directly.

Dont be be the only person on your team who talks to customers. Instead, encourage everyone to do this - this starts at onboarding!

Tell-tale sign is that you're the final decision maker / everyone looks to much to your for guidance 
Acting like a manager or sole decision-maker is a red flag.
Best ideas often come from all team members, not just the lead.
A lead being the bottleneck or central figure can slow down progress.

Maybe: something on making sure you're replacable


## 2. You stopped writing code

Coding should still be ~80-90% of your time. Leadership is an overlay, not a new job description. Your job isn't to run meetings and manage sprints

Prioritize shipping and impact over unnecessary meta-work. (maybe this is a separate point)

## 3. You focus on made up metrics

You forget about the _real_ goal

The real goal isn't activation rates, sign up rates, funnels, etc. Its revenue (and usage and quality?)

Success looks like usages from real users who are actually getting value from your product
 
maybe Something on the cause being you dont lean into understanding your product and what you're building enough. Not engaging deeply with the product: A lead must genuinely understand and care about the product. Without that, it's easy to lose focus or chase abstract, low-impact problems.

Your goal is a team lead is to align your team as much as possible on these goals

Maybe a bit on not focusing on fancy architecture and how every decision you make should be aligned with improving your users value. E.g. increasing your code speed 10% is not something they would notice.

Your resposibilty is to make sure your team hits the goal and produces output

## 4. You're scared of changing goals

Something on how you plan your roadmmap in advance, but never question it until the end of the quarter/half/year. Ultimately your product's success is your responsibility/the buck stops with you, so its up to you to ensure your team is providing value

Instead, use growth reviews for this (can reuse bits from PM newsletter - https://posthog.com/newsletter/product-management-is-broken#4-accountability-through-feedback-loops)

## 5. You don't keep the talent bar high 

Bits on using the [Keeper Test](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/management#the-keeper-test)

Giving regular, hard feedback 

## 6. You try to do it all yourself

you're responsible for the performance of the team and making sure things are getting, not necessarily doing it all yourself

David's failure mode on not reaching out for a PM/ Was hard to dig into onboarding and activation metrics but didn't have time to dig into the data and why (speaking to customers etc), ultimately affecting growth of the product.

Feeling like you have to know all the answers . Your responible for making sure the team is making progress and getting answers, but you dont do it all yourself

Things I could include maybe:

Maybe: A point on how team size doesnt matter, small teams etc. (can use bits from magic of small eng teams)


from dylan:
Pasting from notes app (I’m on a plane) so forgive formatting
success stories
Parallelizing subject matter expertise and shipping twice as fast (more credit to team than me)
Start new hires off with easier stuff and let them ramp rather than throw them at the biggest problem they want to tackle.  Helps them grow confidence and get better faster.
Recruiting my friends to join the team
How it started
I was a small team of 1 for about 2 months and I still just wrote down a lot of learnings, updates, and external processes in my channel even though no one was really there.  Great for referencing later
Set up automations etc early when standing up a new team.
Failure modes
imposing too much process early, then not being intentional about process later.  Not so failure as optimizing
Being a knowledge suck and not letting support heroes etc own it.  Too many pings of @dylan and not enough pings of @feature-flags-team.  Let the team shine! 
Insulating folks from annoying processes rather than letting them tell me when it’s too much. Shoot straight with the team.
Emblematic
Andy hiring was really good; watching the team come together to groom backlog and plan things and collectively unpack all of our shared knowledge of the product we own was a great exercise.
