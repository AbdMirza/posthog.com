Overview cycle

1. Collect ideas.
2. Decide which one to try.
3. Try it.
4. Validate whether or not it's working (you are here)
  - Pivot or persist
5. Repeat until pivots turn to persist.

Promise: After reading this, you’ll have mental models and concrete, tangible steps you can take to validate a new product idea.

- Are you starting a new startup from scratch and not sure exactly what you’re going to build? That’s exactly how PostHog started. James and Tim pivoted 5 times before joining Y Combinator and settling on PostHog, so they’ve got the lessons learned. We’ll take a look at how they validated their ideas to quickly figure out what was working and what wasn’t.
- Are you at an existing company and looking for ways to validate product ideas? PostHog started as a product analytics company. And now it’s grown to 10 separate products (session replay, etc.). We can also share ideas about how

A note on speed. Speed kills. Actually, it’s the lack of speed that kills. If it takes to long, it won’t matter.

Note on getting ideas. This post assumes you already have an idea or ideas. Go read Paul Graham if you’re looking to generate new ideas. This post is about trying and validating.

> **You can’t validate product ideas up front**

## Getting started

This is a good place to start. YC’s startup school curriculum basically starts with “decide if you want to start”, and then jumps right into ideas. And ideas are basically about two things:

- where do you get ideas
- deciding which ideas to try
- how do you evaluate ideas

## The early story of PostHog

How we validated the idea for PostHog.

## How other companies validated their idea

- Look up YC examples?
    - Segment “So you spent 500K and you have nothing?”

## How PostHog validates new product ideas now

- How PostHog validates product ideas now as a multi-product company.

## Mental Models / Advice / Rules

These aren’t ironclad rules. It’s just what worked for us.

### You can’t validate product ideas up front

What does this mean? It means you can’t know what’s going to work beforehand. So you have to ship ideas quickly to see what works and what doesn’t. Only in retrospect will you be able to form the narrative (and then you can tell everyone how you knew it all along).

Examples:

- The movie industry produces [box office bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biggest_box-office_bombs). Surely everyone wants a new Indiana Jones movie! Well not if it sucks ass. In retrospect it’s easy to see that these movies are terrible, but it’s impossible to know in advance.
- **A Portfolio of Small Bets**. Course for indie hackers.
    - Distinction between the predictable world with known outcomes and the “stochastic” world.
    - The **predictable world**: Success is almost guaranteed if you put in the effort. (Study for your test, get a good grade).
    - The **predictable world**: Success is almost guaranteed if you put in the effort. (Example: Education system). Not necessarily easy, but predictable and accessible.
    - The **stochastic world**: Success is mostly randomly determined. Unfamiliar. **Wild differences in degrees of success**. Extremely competitive and unpredictable. Chance plays a huge role. The vast majority fail. Success tends to bring more success.
        - Example of novelists making an "average" of $50K per year, but the average is mostly useless given that there is a massive range between the massive success of some and usual failure of others.
        - Look to stochastic operators. Book publishers, venture capitalists, movie studios.
        - What do these companies do to tame all this uncertainty? **They all build up a portfolio of many parallel bets**.
- William Zinsser on writing.
    - Don’t try to decide in advance what your memoir will be about. Give it time to find you.
    - Put in the work and see where it takes you.
- Dave Chappelle on whether he is in the driver’s seat or the idea is in the driver’s seat. https://rajitkhanna.com/genius/

### One order of magnitude at a time (or, “just add a zero”)

- Annika: How do we go from 10 to 100 to 1,000.
- James: 1,000 to 10,000 to 100,000.

### Go where there’s an existing market.

- Building Tuple as a replacement for ScreenHero died.
- Superhuman and Hey building email clients.
- PostHog: feature flags aren’t new. If anything the innovation is that all these tools are collocated.
- Overly focused on disruption (Uber and Taxis).
- Structure of scientific revolutions.
	- Emergence
	- Multiple discovery or simultaneous invention

### Make something other people want

Are you literally the only person in the world that would want this? YC Make something other people want.

## Tangible Shit to Do

> Most product management advice tends to be too high level to be actionable. It’s rare to find something that’s useful for actual practitioners.

## Getting ideas

Paul Graham has N influential essays about startups. And a whopping 9 of them are about ideas.

https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html

Paul’s advice is that the future is already here to some extent.

Another way to get ideas is to work in the soul sucking field of corporate bollocks.

> I began this journey because I had spent a lot of time in the world of enterprise software sales.

## Deciding on which ideas to try

Don’t look for ideas. Look for problems. And ideally they are problems YOU have.

## Validating whether or not the idea is working

Start with friends, family, colleagues.

> Getting our first 10 users was the hardest part.

Challenge conventional wisdom:
Most people say to validate product ideas by... we say...

Help the audience directly. Our audience is engineers, founders, aspiring founders.
What are the most practical, useful examples of what to actually do?

## Get your first users

Start with friends, family, colleagues.

User request

Something like your "sales with no experience" post, but on validation. Questions:
Should you do dedicated product/feedback meetings? or skip straight to sales meetings?
Does outreach messaging change before/after you have an mvp? What did you say before?
How do you approach outreach messaging for free / open source products?
I'd love examples of invalidating & validating experiences you had. What is it supposed to look like?
I'm struggling with early outreach, essentially step 2 of the PMF game. I've had a short career without much of a network, nor do I have sales experience. It's proving challenging.

I bet I'm not alone. I hope this helps us both!

Meta: I just realized what I’m writing about is exactly what I want to learn. This is a good sign.

## Conclusion and encouragement

The Hero with a Thousand Faces

Trying to validate ideas is challenging, often painful work. There’s a lot of thrashing. You’re going from the known overworld into the unknown underworld. In some sense, it’s what we’re all doing every day. We go to work, we work on an unsolved problem. We write code to solve a problem with no solution. We write words. We share ideas.

Keep going, and you’ll come out with an offering for the world. It’ll be rewarding for both you and for us. Get to work!
