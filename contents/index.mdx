</h1>

**we're building the AI-powered operating system for running a software business.**

this means every piece of software you need for working with customer data and interacting with customers.

<div class="space-y-8 pt-2">

<div id="product-os">

<h2 class="mt-0">14 tools, one customer record</h2>

when all your customer data lives in one place, you can make better decisions. PostHog ships with a [data warehouse](/data-warehouse), [100+ pipelines](/cdp), and SQL access.

even if you don’t need any of these today, they’ll come in handy as you grow.

## customer infrastructure

built-in, PostHog OS ships with:

-   a data warehouse + SQL editor

-   **we ship fast.** see our [changelog](/changelog)
-   **actually-technical support.** our [support people](/support) all have engineering backgrounds.
