    ## pricing
    our usage-based pricing means you don't have to "talk to sales". plus each product has a generous monthly free tier – in fact, 98% of customers use PostHog for free!

<div id="why-posthog?">
    ## why PostHog?
    we're different from most companies for a bunch of reasons:

    - **transparency.** read our [company handbook](/handbook), our [sales manual](/sales-manual), or [company strategy](/strategy)
    - **we ship fast.** see our [changelog](/changelog)
    - **actually-technical support.** our [support people](/support) all have engineering backgrounds.
