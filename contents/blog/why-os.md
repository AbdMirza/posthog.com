There’s a problem with many large websites. Often times, you want to reference content on different pages. Browsers invented tabs, but it feel more like a band-aid than a solution.

AI offers the promise of getting all the content you need on a single page, but it requires:

-   knowing the question you want to ask.
-   trusting that the AI will provide accurate information.

As website creators, we can organize the content as best we can, but we’ll never overcome the natural human behavior of wanting to explore on our own.

So instead of fighting this, we built PostHog.com to act more like an operating system where you can multi-task and open multiple pages simultaneously. And since we all know how to use an OS, there's not much of a learning curve.

This also lends toward breaking out of the mold of whitespace and simplicity in exchange for information density and the ability to access everything with less effort.

So welcome to the new PostHog.com. Be curious, click on things, and discover all the easter eggs that we hope will spark joy in your experience.
