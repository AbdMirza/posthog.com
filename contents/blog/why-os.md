There’s a problem with many large websites. Often times, you want to reference content on different pages. Browsers invented tabs, but it feel more like a band-aid than a solution.

AI offers the promise of getting all the content you need on a single page, but it requires:

-   knowing the question you want to ask.
-   trusting that the AI will provide accurate information.

As website creators, we can organize the content as best we can, but we’ll never overcome the natural human behavior of wanting to explore on our own.

So instead of fighting this, we built PostHog.com to act more like an operating system where you can multi-task and open multiple pages simultaneously. And since we all know how to use an OS, there's not much of a learning curve.

This also means deviating from the industry norm of copious whitespace and longform scrolling in exchange for information density and the ability to access everything with less effort and fewer clicks.

There's also a ton of technical improvements which will make it easier for the PostHog team to maintain content as we grow past 15+ products toward 50 and beyond. And this is just the beginning – we have a ton of stuff we want to do next.

So welcome to the new PostHog.com. Be curious, click around, have some fun. We hope you enjoy your time here as much as we enjoyed building it.

And if you want to _more_ about how and why we did this, [read how the site works](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/how-posthog-website-works).
