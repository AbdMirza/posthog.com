> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

Our primary focus this quarter is product strategy work to define the future of qualitative feedback at PostHog. This includes:

- Define new product focus and vision
- Determine what features we should build and for whom
- Conduct user research and validate assumptions

## 🤖 Goal 2: Better Integrate Max with Survey Responses

> Why: Max can analyze survey responses when you're viewing them, but can't access them from other conversations.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

Enable Max to access and reference survey responses from any conversation, not just when viewing a specific survey. Users should be able to ask "What are users saying about feature X?" or "Summarize my NPS feedback" from anywhere in PostHog.

## ⭐ Goal 3: Continue Excellence on Existing Survey Customers

> Why: Maintain high quality and satisfaction for our current customer base.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

**Key metrics:**
- Track NPS score over time
- Reduce number of support tickets
- Maintain fast response times for ticket resolutions

**Approach:**
- Implement quick wins and fix issues fast
- Proactively address customer pain points
- Regularly gather and act on feedback

## 🏷️ Side Quest: New Name for the Surveys Team

> Why: Our scope is expanding beyond surveys to encompass all qualitative feedback features.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

In the future, we'll maintain not just Surveys but all qualitative feedback features at PostHog. Leading candidate: **Team Feedback** (not finalized yet).
