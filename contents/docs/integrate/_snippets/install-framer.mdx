import Snippet from "../snippet.mdx"

Go to your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet) and copy your web snippet. It looks like this:

<Snippet />

With the JavaScript snippet copied, go to your Framer project and click the gear in the top right to go to your site settings. If you havenâ€™t already, sign up for the "Mini" site plan. This enables you to add custom code.

Once on a paid plan, go to the **General** tab in site settings and scroll down to the **Custom Code** section. Under **End of `<head>` tag**, paste your PostHog JavaScript snippet. Make sure to press **Save** next to the **Custom Code** heading. 

Finally, **publish** your site to have PostHog automatically start capturing events.
