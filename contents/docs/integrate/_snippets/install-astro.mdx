import Snippet from "../snippet.mdx"

In your `src/components` folder, create a `posthog.astro` file:

```bash
cd ./src/components 
# or 'cd ./src && mkdir components && cd ./components' if your components folder doesnt exist 
touch posthog.astro
```

In this file, add your `Web snippet` which you can find in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet). Be sure to include the `is:inline` directive [to prevent Astro from processing it](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#opting-out-of-processing), or you will get Typescript and build errors that property 'posthog' does not exist on type 'Window & typeof globalThis'.

The next step is to a create a [Layout](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/) where we will use `posthog.astro`. Create a new file `PostHogLayout.astro` in your `src/layouts` folder:

```bash
cd .. && cd .. # move back to your base directory if you're still in src/components/posthog.astro
cd ./src/layouts
# or 'cd ./src && mkdir layouts && cd ./layouts' if your layouts folder doesn't exist yet
touch PostHogLayout.astro
```

Add the following code to `PostHogLayout.astro`:

```astro file=PostHogLayout.astro
---
import PostHog from '../components/posthog.astro'
---
<head>
	<PostHog />
</head>
```

Lastly, update `index.astro` to wrap your existing app components with the new Layout:

```astro file=index.astro
---
import PostHogLayout from '../layouts/PostHogLayout.astro';
---
<PostHogLayout>
  <!-- your existing app components -->
</PostHogLayout>
```
