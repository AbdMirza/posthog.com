Revenue tracking enables you to capture revenue from your application via the events you are already sending us, or via an integration between your payment platform and our Data Warehouse, which you can then track in your [revenue analytics dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/revenue_analytics).

## Choosing your reporting currency

PostHog will automatically convert revenue from other currencies into your chosen reporting currency – i.e. if someone makes a purchase in Canadian Dollars (CAD) and your reporting currency is US Dollars (USD), it's converted into USD in PostHog to ensure consistency.

You can configure your reporting currency at the top of your [revenue analytics settings](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

## Choosing your revenue data sources

PostHog can collect revenue from two different types of sources:

### Option 1: Data warehouse tables

The simplest way to send us revenue data is from your [Data Warehouse](/data-warehouse) tables.

    alt="Data warehouse tables setup"
    classes="rounded"
/>

The configuration for these is much simpler. You simply need to create a connection between PostHog and your revenue source and PostHog will automatically pick up the revenue data for you.
Please refer to the [Data Warehouse docs](/data-warehouse) for more information.

> **Important:** We currently only support revenue analytics data from Stripe. The Chargebee connector already exists and integration with revenue analytics is coming soon. We'll also implement integrations with RevenueCat and Polar in the near future. Check our roadmap at [our team page](/teams/revenue-analytics).

## Deferred revenue

When using revenue data from your Data Warehouse (like Stripe), PostHog will automatically defer revenue recognition to match your accounting practices. This means we'll spread the revenue across all the months a charge is relevant for.

You can learn more about this on the [deferred revenue](/docs/revenue-analytics/deferred-revenue) page.

### Option 2: Properties on events

A different way to send us revenue data is through revenue generating events, such as when a purchase is completed, a user starts a subscription, or a subscription is renewed.

When you do so, you need to include two properties:

- **Revenue property**: The amount of revenue generated by the event (usually in their minor unit, such as cents of a dollar, pence of a pound, yen, etc.).
- **Currency property** (optional): The currency of the revenue in ISO 4217 format (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) - or select a static currency for all events.

You can choose any name you like for these properties – you can customize them in the **Revenue** tab in [data management](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

    alt="Events setup"
    classes="rounded"

The currency property is technically optional as you can choose a static currency when configuring your revenue event in your dashboard, but we recommend sending it if you can to ensure backward compatibility should you ever take payments in a different currency.

#### Optional properties (product and growth/churn tracking)

You can improve the amount of information you track by including some extra optional properties on your events and configuring them appropriately in the events modal.
These will let you breakdown revenue by product, track growth/churn, and more.

- **Product property**: The name of the product that the event is related to. This will let you breakdown revenue by product.
- **Coupon property**: The name of the coupon that was used to purchase the product. This will let you track revenue by coupon/initial coupon.
- **Subscription property**: An unique identifier for the subscription that the event is related to. This will let you track revenue by subscription and also properly track churn/growth appropriately.

For subscription you can also let us know how we should handle churn by specifying after how much time after the last event for a given subscription we should consider it to have churned.
You can also customize whether we consider the user to have churned the day the last event happened or after the dropoff period.

#### Currency minor unit

You can choose between sending the currency the minor unit of the currency or the full amount.
We'll expect the whole amount by default (i.e. $20.45) but we suggest you send the minor unit of the currency instead (i.e. 2045) to avoid floating point precision issues.

When sending the minor unit of the currency, we'll treat it as follows:
- `1045` in `USD` (or any other two-decimal currency) is treated as $10.45
- `1045` in `JPY` (or any other zero-decimal currency) is treated as ¥1045

##### Zero-decimal currencies

When you enable "values are in cents" (minor unit), we consider most currencies to be two-decimal currencies unless they are in the following list:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <ul>
        <li>BIF</li>
        <li>CLP</li>
        <li>DJF</li>
        <li>GNF</li>
        <li>JPY</li>
        <li>KMF</li>
        <li>KRW</li>
        <li>MGA</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>PYG</li>
        <li>RWF</li>
        <li>UGX</li>
        <li>VND</li>
        <li>VUV</li>
        <li>XAF</li>
        <li>XOF</li>
        <li>XPF</li>
    </ul>   
</div>

There's also one exception to the day-to-day usage of each currency, and that's the Icelandic Krona (ISK). The Icelandic Krona (ISK) is a zero-decimal currency, but we treat it as a two-decimal currency to keep backwards compatibility with our integration with Stripe.
