> **Important:** Revenue analytics is currently in beta. At this stage, Revenue analytics is optimized for small/medium-sized companies. If you process more than 20,000 transactions/month you might have performance issues. Similarly, at this stage we're optimized for customers running on a subscription model (mostly SaaS). If you're running a business where your revenue is not coming from recurring payments, you might find Revenue analytics to be less useful/more empty than expected.

Our [revenue analytics dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/revenue_analytics) allows you to break down your revenue by a lot of different metrics.

You can breakdown by product, plan, customer, etc.

For example, you can see how much revenue you're making from customers in each of your supported countries:
