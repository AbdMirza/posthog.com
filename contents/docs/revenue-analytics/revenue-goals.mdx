> **Important:** Revenue analytics is currently in beta. At this stage, Revenue analytics is optimized for small/medium-sized companies. If you process more than 20,000 transactions/month you might have performance issues. Similarly, at this stage we're optimized for customers running on a subscription model (mostly SaaS). If you're running a business where your revenue is not coming from recurring payments, you might find Revenue analytics to be less useful/more empty than expected.

You can configure revenue goals to track your revenue targets in the [revenue analytics settings](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

These goals will then be displayed in the [revenue analytics dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/revenue_analytics) on the MRR/ARR or Gross Revenue charts - you get to decide where they show up.

We'll only display goals that are within the selected time range OR if they're past but you haven't achieved them yet.
