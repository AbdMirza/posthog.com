You can configure revenue goals to track your revenue targets in the [revenue analytics settings](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

These goals will then be displayed in the [revenue analytics dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/revenue_analytics) on the MRR/ARR or Gross Revenue charts - you get to decide where they show up.

We'll only display goals that are within the selected time range OR if they're past but you haven't achieved them yet.
