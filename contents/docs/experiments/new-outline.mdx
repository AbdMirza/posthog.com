		- Navigate to Experiments and click "New experiment"
		- Explanation of each form field:
			- Name
			- Feature flag key

			- Participant type
			- Variants
			- Holdout group
				- Link to holdouts documentation
- Defining experiments with code
- Designing no-code experiments
- [Testing and launching](/docs/experiments/testing-and-launching)

- Evaluating results
	- Use the second part of the existing 'Testing and launching' doc.

## Features

- [Experiments without feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags)
	- Should this move to Guides?
- [Holdouts](/docs/experiments/holdouts)
	- Keep existing doc

## Methodology

- Statistics primer
- Trends with count
- Trends with property value
- Funnels
	- Attribution type: Funnels allow you to have the attribution assigned at any point in the funnel, not just the first step. If the user assigned to a variant later on in the funnel, then they'll be included in the entire funnel.
- [Traffic allocation](/docs/experiments/traffic-allocation)
- [Sample size and running time](/docs/experiments/sample-size-running-time)

## TBD

- [Experiment significance](/docs/experiments/experiment-significance)


- Chat bot that tells you how to set up an experiment?
