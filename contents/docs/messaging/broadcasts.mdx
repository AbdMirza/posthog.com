Broadcasts in PostHog enable you to send one-time messages to a specific audience. Unlike [campaigns](/docs/messaging/campaigns) which can be triggered by events or scheduled, broadcasts are sent immediately to all users who match your targeting criteria at the time of sending.

## When to use broadcasts

Broadcasts are ideal for:

- Newsletters
- Product or event invitations
- Feature release announcements
- Maintenance notifications

## Getting started

To create an email broadcast:

1. Go to **Messaging** > **Broadcasts** in your PostHog instance
2. Click **New broadcast**
3. Define your recipient audience using the Filters section
4. Configure your email content or select an existing [template](/docs/messaging/message-templates)
5. Use our [Liquid templating](/docs/messaging/liquid-templating) to personalize your emails with person properties
6. (Optional) Use the **Test broadcast** section to send the broadcasts to yourself and validate the content
7. Save your broadcast and trigger delivery using the **Send broadcast** section
