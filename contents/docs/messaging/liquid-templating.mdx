PostHog's messaging features support [Liquid templating](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to personalize your messages with dynamic content.

## Variables

PostHog emails can include variables that get replaced with actual values when the message is sent. Common variables include:

- Person properties (e.g., `{{ person.properties.email }}`)
- Event properties (e.g., `{{ event.properties.message }}`)

You can use curly braced variables in a Message's "To", "From", "Subject", and inside email content.

## Supported features

Currently, PostHog only supports basic variable substitution with Liquid. More advanced Liquid features like conditional rendering (`{% if %}`) or loops (`{% for %}`) are not yet supported.

## Available variables

You can use the following variables in your templates:

- Person data
  - ID: `person.id`
  - Properties: `person.properties.firstName`

- Event data
  - Event name: `event.event`
  - Properties: `event.properties.cartCheckoutAmount`

- Group data
  - Properties: `groups.yourGroupType.properties.subscriptionTier`
