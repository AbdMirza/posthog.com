Messaging allows you to send emails to your early access lists, newsletter subscribers, or app users. Currently you can send the following types of email messages:

- **[Broadcasts](/docs/messaging/broadcasts)**: Manually triggered broadcasts, sent to a list of people. Broadcasts are useful for newsletters, product updates, or early invite lists 

- **[Campaigns](/docs/messaging/campaigns)**: Event-triggered transactional emails. Campaigns enable you to automatically sending messages to your users in response to their activity in your app
