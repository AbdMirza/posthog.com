## Authentication errors

**Problem**: Getting 401 Unauthorized errors when sending logs.

**Solutions**:
- Verify your JWT token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the JWT token contains a `team_id` claim
- Check that the JWT secret matches between your client and the log capture service
- Verify the Authorization header format: `Bearer {your-jwt-token}`

## Connection issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to the log capture service on port 4317.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the log capture service is running: `curl http://your-posthog-host:8000/_readiness`
- Check that port 4317 is accessible from your application
- Ensure firewall rules allow outbound connections to port 4317
- Verify the endpoint URL format: `http://your-posthog-host:4317/v1/logs`

## Logs not appearing in PostHog

**Problem**: Logs are being sent but don't appear in the PostHog interface.

**Solutions**:
- Check that the JWT token contains the correct `team_id`
- Verify logs are being sent in the correct OTLP format
- Check the log capture service logs for processing errors
- Ensure your team has access to the Logs feature in PostHog

## Performance issues

**Problem**: High memory usage or slow log processing.

**Solutions**:
- Adjust the batch size in your OpenTelemetry configuration
- Consider using asynchronous log processing
- Monitor the log capture service metrics at `/metrics`
- Check for network latency between your application and the log service

## Log format problems

**Problem**: Logs are being received but not parsed correctly.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're using the standard [OTLP log format](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)
- Verify log levels are set correctly (INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc.)
- Check that log attributes are properly structured
- Use the OpenTelemetry logging APIs instead of raw log libraries

## Team association issues

**Problem**: Logs are appearing under the wrong team or not associated with any team.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the `team_id` in your JWT token matches your PostHog team ID
- Check that the JWT token is being sent with each log batch
- Ensure the log capture service is using the correct JWT secret for validation
- Contact support if team IDs are not matching expected values

## Still having issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. Check the log capture service logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your OpenTelemetry client configuration matches the examples
3. Test with a simple log message first before sending complex logs
4. Contact PostHog support with your specific error messages and configuration details
