PostHog logs is a powerful logging solution that works with the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). 
You don't need any vendor specific SDKs â€“ just use standard OpenTelemetry libraries.

Once you have OpenTelemetry installed, you need to configure your client to send logs to PostHog:

- Set the gRPC endpoint to `http://your-posthog-host:4317`
- Include a JWT token with your team ID in the Authorization header
- Use the standard [OTLP log format](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)

Once your logs are flowing into PostHog, you can:

- **Search through logs** by level, message content, or custom attributes
- **Filter by time ranges** to find specific events
- **Correlate logs with events** from your PostHog analytics

Navigate to the Logs section in your PostHog dashboard to start exploring your log data.

Common issues you might encounter when setting up logging:

- **Authentication errors** - Make sure your JWT token includes the correct team_id
- **Connection issues** - Verify the gRPC endpoint and port 4317 are accessible
- **Log format problems** - Ensure you're using the standard [OTLP log format](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)
