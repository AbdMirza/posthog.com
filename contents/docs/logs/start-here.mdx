PostHog Logs is a powerful logging solution that works with the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). 
Unlike traditional logging services, you don't need any PostHog-specific SDKs â€“ just use standard OpenTelemetry libraries.

PostHog's log capture service receives logs via gRPC on port 4317 and processes them based on team authentication using JWT tokens.

Once you have OpenTelemetry installed, you need to configure your client to send logs to PostHog:

- Set the gRPC endpoint to `http://your-posthog-host:4317`
- Include a JWT token with your team ID in the Authorization header
- Use the standard OTLP log format

The beauty of PostHog Logs is that it's fully OTLP-compliant, so it works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible client.

Once your logs are flowing into PostHog, you can:

- **Search through logs** by level, message content, or custom attributes
- **Filter by time ranges** to find specific events
- **Analyze log patterns** with built-in aggregation tools
- **Set up alerts** based on log content or error rates
- **Correlate logs with events** from your PostHog analytics

Navigate to the Logs section in your PostHog dashboard to start exploring your log data.

Common issues you might encounter when setting up logging:

- **Authentication errors** - Make sure your JWT token includes the correct team_id
- **Connection issues** - Verify the gRPC endpoint and port 4317 are accessible
- **Log format problems** - Ensure you're using the standard OTLP log format
