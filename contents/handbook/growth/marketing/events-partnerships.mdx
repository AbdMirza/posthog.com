This page covers how we organize real-world or virtual events for our community, not [internal events](/handbook/company/offsites) or [app events](/docs/data/events). 

We have so far:
* Sponsored several hackathons and events, such as the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues/1759">ElevenLabs + x16z Worldwide Hackathon</PrivateLink>.
* Hosted <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues/608">our own developer meetup in London</PrivateLink>

However, we're definitely interested in developing a uniquely PostHog approach to events. If you're a community partner with an idea for a quirky, developer-centric, interesting event, please reach out to [Kevan](/community/profiles/32499).

Here is what we are learning from our first steps into events:

## Sponsoring an event
Our goal with all our events is to connect with our community in a genuine, human way. We don't just sponsor events where we get our logo on the brochure for 'brand exposure' and nothing else. 

### How to filter potential event sponsorship opportunities
- **Is the host brand interesting?** We want the hosts themselves to be brands we’re keen on. That should mean they’re serving our ICP and industry, and ideally doing their own interesting, innovative thing in the world.
- **Is the event itself interesting?** Check the event’s purpose, principles, and participants before agreeing. We don’t do boring partnerships or events. We focus on makers. We like new things. 
- **Can PostHog help bring it to the next level?**  Ideally, our role is to make an event “more interesting,” not more of the same. This can include practical technology components and demos, an interesting branded experience or collab.
- **Is there a reasonable time window for collaborating?** Do a little math to consider what might be needed to do this well —  physical goods, travel, attendance and promotion — especially if international travel or shipping is required. 

### Checklist of questions for sponsoring events
Ask these questions to determine what specific tasks PostHog might need to do. Use this [Event plan Issue template](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/event-plan.md) to track it. 
- **People:** Are PostHog people needed in person? What level, role or skill? 
- **Asks of the people:** Will there be a talk? Networking? Demos? Participation?
- **Goods/merch:** Will physical objects (shirts, giveaways, signage) be needed?
- **Social media:** What kind of co-promoting is expected?
- **Artwork and branding:** Are unique, custom assets needed?
- **Online support:** Will live and realtime support or communication be needed during the event?
- **Communication:** In-house at PostHog, and beyond, what needs to be shared? 
- **Travel:** Is travel going to be part of it? Who, when, where, how? 
- **Timeline:** When is it happening, and when do we need all this by?

### Make your plan and build your team
- Pick an event owner who is responsible for coordinating the event and making sure that everything goes smoothly. 
- Create an Issue that covers the event sponsorship, and assign it to the event owner. [Example event Issue](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues/1759), [Event plan Issue template](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/event-plan.md).

### Participating in partner events
- Travel in such a way that you can arrive on-time, well-rested, early and ready to support well
- Plan in advance to bring everything you need: laptop, adapters, slides, merch, signs, etc.
- Have speaking remarks prepared, and anticipate playing a role speaking on-stage to give PostHog further visibility 
- Wear PostHog merch so you are visible part of the team
- Act as a co-host, supporting the hosting team, and offering encouragement as the event goes along
- While business cards are perhaps antiquated, have a plan for sharing contact info with people you meet (LinkedIn, Bump, etc)
- Be on a mission to meet people; it’s part of the event function. Ask and answer questions. 
- Don’t cluster in a clique: If attending with our PostHog teammates, spread out, don’t loiter as a wolfpack
- Finish line: know what constitutes “done” for your presence at the event (don’t leave early or without checking with the host)
