Notes on what to add:
- when to do renewal (at least 2 months out) - there are tasks and alerts in Vitally / Slack
- involving customers in the process
- quotehog
- estimating amount required
- pricing change overs - explicitly talk about pricing changeovers in renewal conversation, mention to Mine to update
- updating salesforce
