# Renewal principals
Being on an annual plan is a win-win solution for both PostHog and the customer. Customers get discounts on the credits they purchase and PostHog gets confirmed revenue. Therefore, it is in everyone's interest to ensure 

When estimating renewal amount, we want to make sure we accurately determine the amount of credits the customer will need in the next 12 months. This is not an opportunity to upsell.

# When to Start
You should start talking to customers about renewals 2 months before their current contract will end. Vitally and Slack will send tasks and alerts to keep you on track. 2 months before the contract end date, the customer will enter the `Upcoming renewal` segment, a task will be created and assigned to you, and you will be also notified in Slack.

Start by sending a message in the shared Slack channel. Things will change in a year – the person you worked with previously may not be the right person this time. Mention when the customer is set to renew and ask if they have any preferred next steps.

Considered an early renewal. You will get notified by credit bot. Follow the same process.


# Renewal discussions
Renewal conversations are best done on a call. There can be a lot of moving parts so talking through it is usually a good idea. 

Before the call, review your customer's usage and start a quote in Quotehog (link). If you need to look at data beyond the last 6 months, you can use this PostHog dashboard (link to billable usage). Check if your customer is on any legacy pricing tiers and either talk to them about moving to standard pricing, or take it into account when building a quote. 

During the call, start with understanding their experience of PostHog in the past year and what didn't work well. It's good to constantly ask about potential frustrations. Also explore the coming year and talk about upcoming plans, projects, other teams who might be interested in exploring PostHog. This context is useful to build an accurate estimation and are initiatvies you can build on in the future.

Then, remind your customer how contracts, credits and discounts work at PostHog. It can be helpful to talk through our pricing philosophy and discounting approach.

Walk through the quote. Start by looking at their past usage – try to anchor to the main products they're using as there can be a lot of numbers to look at. Walk through the quote, explaining how you estimated the usage for each product to arrive at the final number.

After the call - send the quote.

# Negotiations
Usually, you don't need to do any negotiations as our discounting approach follows a framework.
