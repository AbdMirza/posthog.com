This is a guide to podcasting at PostHog.

## Purpose and themes

The goal of the podcast is the same as that of our Product for Engineers newsletter.

> Helping engineers and founders build great products.

> focuses on product and business lessons and information for engineers.

So, why have a podcast if we already have other great content?

### Stories and specifics

- Stories: The podcast format gives us an opportunity to tell stories that wouldn't fit into a tightly written article.
- Specifics: It also gives us an opportunity to shed some more light on things we gloss over in writing. We might mention something in passing in an article, but the podcast gives us an opportunity to do deep dives and share more. For example, ...

Aligns with our marketing goals and growth of PostHog.

## Audience

The podcast is primarily intended for founders and engineers that are building products. See also our [Who we are building for](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for) and our [ICP](/newsletter/ideal-customer-profile-framework)

We also want the podcast to be more broadly accessible to product managers. So we don’t necessarily want to do technical deep dives. (or do we?)

## Cadence

Maintain a sustainable pace.

The long-term goal is that we'll release an episode every other week. We release a newsletter, then a podcast episode, then a newsletter, then a podcast episode, etc.

Initially, we're recording episodes every week as we experiment with the format and get our legs under us.

## Content and episode topics

We'd like to find a cycle of episode formats we can work with. For instance, we can record the following four types of episodes and then repeat the cycle.

- Episode 1: Discuss a topic from our newsletter with James
- Episode 2: James interviews a technical founder
- Episode 3: AMA episode with community questions
- Episode 4: TBD

The advice for our [newsletter topics](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter#topic) applies to our podcast as well.

See also [Kathy Sierra's content](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019) on why someone would want to listen.

### What should we avoid?

This section is subject to change, but initially there are a couple types of content we intend to avoid.

- "Behind the Scenes" episodes that don't have any obvious value to our audience. There are likely some fascinating episodes we could produce about "How PostHog does XYZ", but the intention is to create content that's geniunely useful to our core audience (see above). See "The Whole Hog" podcast.
- Overly technical deep dives.

## Format

...

## Best Practices

### Reveal the human, personal side

...

### Engaging and entertaining

If it's not engaging and entertaining, no one is going to want to listen even if we have useful, valuable content.

This is not just for the audience. We also want to ensure the podcast conversations are fun enough for us to want to continue doing them.

### Host

- There's no need to be salesy.
- Avoid "let's talk about X for a while". Keep the conversation focused on what the audience would want to know more about.
- Keep asking questions to dive deeper. Don't just cover a topic and then move on to the next.

### Production

Remove the “ums” and “uhs” but don’t overdo it or it feels a bit jumpy.

### Publishing

Set a sustainable pace. If someone needs to go on vacation for a week, the entire podcasting infrastructure shouldn't need to come crashing down.

- Apple Podcasts
- Spotify
- Substack
- YouTube

#### Social

- Share episodes on social channels
- PostHog twitter account
- James's twitter account

### Intros

The podcast intros should briefly introduce why it makes sense to listen to us. Build credibility. The lessons from our [newsletter intros](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter#intro) apply to the podcast as well.

### Thumbnails and titles

See YouTube's [guide to thumbnails and titles](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12340300?hl=en).

> A thumbnail is 90% the psychology of the click, and 10% about the design.

> The decision to click/listen is driven by “the curiosity gap” the gap between what we currently know and what we want to know.

## What should we avoid?

- Unsustainable pace.
- Boring conversations.

## Inbox

### Notes from chat with Cory and James

Split episode into segments with a short rest to keep energy levels.

### Notes from conversation with Andy

Potentially having 3 people instead of 2
either 2 interviewers or 2 guests
James should be in 80%+ of the episodes, but occasionally special guests
We want PostHog guests, but on a topic and not just “behind the scenes”
Episode idea: James and Charles on ops
For the script, have giant headings with copious spacing
Start with a contrarian point, “most people say… right?”
