This guide to podcasting at PostHog includes:

- Big picture: themes, goals, and the purpose of the podcast
- Best practices: what should we
- Process: how we plan, record, edit, and publish episodes
- Practical tips: specific guidelines and recommendations for producing the podcast
- Tools: tools we use to assemble podcast episodes

We're very new to podcasting, so a lot of the ideas and "best practices" are hypotheses about what will work well. But the plan is to use this as a place to capture lessons we learn and evolve over time.

## Purpose and themes

The goal for our podcast is to help developers build successful products by sharing practical insights, lessons learned, and real experiences from PostHog and other technical founders.

Following the success of our newsletter.

Like our [newsletter](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter), we focus on product and business lessons that are especially relevant for engineers - whether they're building side projects, launching startups, or leading product teams.

conversations

> Have interesting people. Not just having a conversation.

Ask questions from the perspective of the audience.

So, why have a podcast if we already have other great content?

- Stories: The podcast format gives us an opportunity to tell stories that wouldn't fit into a tightly written article. A more personal touch.
- Conversations: ...
- Highlight the people behind the product. Make it personal and human. Reveal. Approachable.
- Specifics: It also gives us an opportunity to shed some more light on things we gloss over in writing. We might mention something in passing in an article, but the podcast gives us an opportunity to do deep dives and share more. The back and forth nature of a conversation gives us a chance to push back and ask to clarify.

Ask questions based on genuine curiosity (see Joe Rogan).

> **Don't be salesy.**

> **A quirky, well-researched podcast.**

Also aligns with our marketing goals and growth of PostHog.

Who is it for?

Developers, founders, product managers, indie hackers.

The podcast is primarily intended for founders and engineers that are building products. See also our [Who we are building for](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for) and our [ICP](/newsletter/ideal-customer-profile-framework)

We also want the podcast to be more broadly accessible to product managers. So we don’t necessarily want to do technical deep dives. (or do we?)

If it's not engaging and entertaining, no one is going to want to listen even if we have useful, valuable content.

This is not just for the audience. We also want to ensure the podcast conversations are fun enough for us to want to continue doing them.

## Content, format, and episode topics

What kinds of content do we feature for episdoes?

We'd like to find a cycle of episode formats we can work with. For instance, we can record the following four types of episodes and then repeat the cycle.

- Episode 1: Discuss a topic from our newsletter with James
- Episode 2: James interviews a technical founder
- Episode 3: AMA episode with community questions
- Episode 4: TBD

The advice for our [newsletter topics](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter#topic) applies to our podcast as well.

Split into seasonal episode themes.
Split episodes into segments with a short rest to keep energy levels.

- Ideally have three people on an episode (1 interviewer and 2 guests or 2 interviewer and 1 guest).
- Share mistakes and fails too, not just wins. "Flounder" (via Kevan)
- For product management, try to find content that's useful for practitioners. It should be applicable, and not too high level. (via Annika)

How long should episodes be?

We're shooting for 30-40 minute episodes, but we could go longer when we have external guests.

What kinds of content should we avoid?

- "Behind the Scenes" episodes that don't have any obvious value to our audience. There are likely some fascinating episodes we could produce about "How PostHog does XYZ", but the intention is to create content that's geniunely useful to our core audience (see above). See "The Whole Hog" podcast.
- Overly technical deep dives.

### Episodes

Start with a contrarian point, “most people think X, why not?"

## Publishing

### Cadence

Maintain a sustainable pace.

The long-term goal is that we'll release an episode every other week. We release a newsletter, then a podcast episode, then a newsletter, then a podcast episode, etc.

Initially, we're recording episodes every week as we experiment with the format and get our legs under us.

If someone needs to go on vacation for a week, the entire podcasting infrastructure shouldn't need to come crashing down.

## Best Practices

### Intros

The podcast intros should briefly introduce why it makes sense to listen to us. Build credibility. The lessons from our [newsletter intros](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter#intro) apply to the podcast as well.

Give some context, but avoid overly long intros.

### Hosting and interviewing

> "We can afford to be weird." Joe

> Felt too easy. Could be more intense. Don't need to be salesy.

- Be investigative. Challenge. Be skeptical. Be curious.
- Conversations should be fun and exciting. If you're bored the audience will be bored too.
- Split episode into segments with a short rest to keep energy levels.
- Schedule brief breaks in the conversation to avoid lulls.
- Rehearse the intro. If you make a mistake, stop and start again.
- There's no need to be salesy.
- Avoid "let's talk about X for a while". Keep the conversation focused on what the audience would want to know more about.
- Keep asking questions to dive deeper. Don't just cover a topic and then move on to the next.

### Scripts

- Structure and script to prevent overly verbose answers.

For the script, have giant headings with copious spacing

### Editing

Remove the “ums” and “uhs” but don’t overdo it or it feels a bit jumpy. Be wary of "magic AI" fixes that may mangle the audio.

### Titles and thumbnails

> The decision to click/listen is driven by “the curiosity gap” the gap between what we currently know and what we want to know.

See YouTube's [guide to thumbnails and titles](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12340300?hl=en).
