We know how crucial the early stages of using PostHog can be. Nothing is more reassuring than having a human to connect with and talk things through.

### Principles

Our onboarding program was created to offer necessary help, increase the value our customers get from PostHog, and assist them in achieving their business goals.

The program is guided by a few key principles:

- Help with initial setup, configuration, and billing
- Offer advice on usage and provide clarity on billing
- Act as strategic partners in achieving business goals
- Adapt to varied levels of engagement while ensuring value for everyone
- Encourage time spent in PostHog, trying things out. Adoption can be fun!
- Share best practices to leverage PostHog tailored to specific use cases

### Structure

The current program spans over **8 weeks** and involves the following:

- Initial outreach - We share observations on current usage and optimization tips.
- First online meeting - Hands-on implementation of optimization practices. During this call, we also offer them the opportunity to schedule a second meeting if they are willing to dive deeper into any areas.
- Second online meeting - This is an optional meeting for customers interested in a deeper dive into using PostHog to achieve their business goals. After they share their initial goals or KPIs, we schedule a call. More team members are welcome!
- PostHog homework - It’s sent in the follow-up email to reinforce concepts we covered on the call.
- Final outreach - A last check to ensure usage and configuration are solid. We share additional educational resources and highlight where to find ongoing help.

## Tracking in Vitally

Going forward, we only have one main segment: `Onboarding Lead`. We'll be retiring `Onboarding - engaged` as soon as we have worked through all the legacy accounts.

There are two paths for customers to progress through the onboarding process: those who engage with us in some way, and those that show no engagement at all.

These are the statuses we use to track users in the new **Onboarding Pipeline** property:

1. New Account - where new customers land when they enter the `Onboarding Lead` segment.
2. Onboarding Initiated - assigned as soon as we send out the initial outreach email.
3a. Engaged – Email - assigned as soon as a customer responds to our initial outreach email.
3b. Engaged – Call booked - assigned as soon as a customer books a call with us.
4a. Intro Call Completed - assigned to them (manually) when the first call is completed.
4b. Second Call Completed - assigned to them (manually) when we complete the second call, diving deeper into their specific KPIs and business goals.
4c. Homework Offered - assigned (manually) only to those who have completed a second call with us, and receive tailored homework so they can learn how to use PostHog and apply specifically to their business needs.
5. Awaiting Final Outreach - assigned (manually) to both engaged and unengaged customers; this is the final stage where we review their account and share any final suggestions, and wrap up their onboarding process.
6a. Onboarded – No Engagement - assigned (manually) to those who never engaged with us in any way.
6b. Onboarded – Engaged - assigned (manually) to those who engaged either over email or also in a call.
6c. Sales Handoff - assigned to customers we [hand over to sales](/handbook/onboarding/sales-handover) when we add the `Create AE Lead` segment; this can happen at any stage throughout the process.
6d. Churned - assigned to churned customers.

Stages `3a` to `4c` only happen for those customers that engaged with us over email or in a call. For those that never engage with us, they skip immediately to `5. Awaiting Final Outreach`. These statuses are handled by <PrivateLink url="https://posthog.vitally-eu.io/settings/playbooks/481c2fc5-1c52-412c-a20a-e062c9d02abc">the main onboarding playbook in Vitally</PrivateLink>. Some of these statuses need to be assigned manually as indicated.

#### Timeline (approximate)

Our customers enter the segment at different points in their journey (e.g. credits roll offs, projecting a first bill for any reason). Our goal is to reach out to them within the first week since they enter our segment, schedule the first call within the second/third week, schedule the second call within their fourth/fifth week, offer homework within the fifth/sixth week, and check in with them one more time on the seventh/eighth week.

We are very flexible with the engaged customers and would often extend the onboarding window to suit their needs. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that they are onboarded and happy with the product.
