AKA our [ideal customer profile](/newsletter/ideal-customer-profile-framework) or ICP (ie, the company), and our persona (ie, the person).

We build for the people building the **most-loved products** at **high-growth startups**. 

Marketing and customer success should primarily focus on this ICP, but should also develop **high-*potential* customers** â€“ customers that are likely to later become high-growth customers (e.g. PostHog itself during YC). We should be in maintenance mode for **hobbyists**, such as engineers building side projects. We want to be the first tool that technical founders add to their product.

Because we have a lot of products, we support a few different _personas_, depending on the stage of the company (see [our current persona](#our-current-persona) section below).

## Our current ICP

| &nbsp; | High-growth startup |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Startups that have product-market fit and are quickly scaling up with new customers, hiring, and adding more revenue. |
| **Criteria** | - 15-500 employees<br />- $100k+/month in revenue _or_ very large number of consumer users<br />- Raised from leading investors<br />- Not yet IPO'ed |
| **Why they matter?** | - Able to efficiently monetize them<br />- Very quick sales cycle<br />- Act as key opinion leaders for earlier-stage startups/slower moving companies<br />- Strong opinions on what they need - helping us build a better product |
| **Examples** | PostHog anytime from their Series B to IPO, Supabase, 11Labs |

Each team will focus more or less on different members of the product team. This is detailed on their team pages.

## Our current Persona

During the life of PostHog, we've tried to build different types of tools for different types of people (or, personas). We've found that, as companies get bigger, the type of person that uses a product changes. As an example:

- We built product analytics for engineers at startups
- As those companies get a little bit bigger, they'll hire Product Managers who will mostly use product analytics. PMs have more complicates requirements for what a product analytics tool needs to do
- Even bigger companies often have specialised "analytics engineers". These people are the most demanding.

Some of our products will have multiple personas. It's up to each product team to decide who those are, and how to prioritise between them. 

We've not always been successful at building products for personas other than engineers. We're now at a stage where we need to be in order to continue growing. 

### New products

With AI, we think the biggest change that has happened and will happen is: generalists > specialists. Before, products would be built by teams of engineers, PMs, designers, marketeers and data engineers. Now, a single builder, using AI, can do a lot of these jobs, and that'll continue to be more true over time.

Builders, whether they call themselves developers, product engineers or founders, have always been the most excited users of PostHog, and the keenest to use new products. **That means we want to build new products a builder would use**, products like error tracking, logs and LLM analytics.

There are also products that those builders will often be the first to set up and use, but currently hand over to specialists. Think of a data warehouse (handed over to data engineers), experimenation platform (handed over to PMs, growth engineers or analytics engineers) or messaging platform (marketing). We should build these products so that the builder can delay the point at which they need to hire a specialist to use that product. For example, by making it super easy to set up email campaigns (part written by AI) you don't need to hire a dedicated marketing person for a while.

We don't want to build products where the initial persona is someone other than a builder. Think a CRM, customer support product or marketing tools.
