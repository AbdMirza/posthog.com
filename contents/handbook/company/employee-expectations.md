## Introduction

People who work at PostHog have come from all sorts of different backgrounds - large companies, small companies, agencies, single-founder startups. The modes of working at these places necessarily differ from each other and from PostHog. However, when you're brought on to work as an employee at PostHog, we expect you to work in some fairly specific ways. And being the transparent company that we are, we want to let you know about those expectations, because you can only meet expectations when you are aware of them.

Generally, our [values](https://posthog.com/handbook/values) are a great place to start, as well as our doc on [culture](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture). Here are a few specific ways to apply those values and cultures:

## Ask for help, but only after you've tried first

If you've just joined us, there's a lot you probably don't know. That's okay! However, we _do_ expect that you try to help yourself before asking for help. Here's a framework to use as a guide:

- If it's an internal product
  - We expect you to read our docs
  - We expect you to search through slack
  - If it's in beta, it might be buggy or missing features - definitely request/report them, but also figure out how to do your job with plan B and plan C if it won't be fixed quickly -- this is what we generally call grit
- If it's an external product
  - We expect you to read the docs
  - If it takes you more than 10 mins to figure out then ask someone else internally
- If it's code
  - Spend at least an hour on trying to get yourself unstuck, but not more than 2

And in all cases, take a moment explaining how you've tried to help yourself and linking to resources. That saves others valuable time searching the docs again, or typing up a suggestion to do just that.

## Don't expect perfection

PostHog is a startup. As solid as our stack / product / CI / dev ex is for a company of our size (super solid tbh), it might not be the extremely-well-oiled machine you had at BigCo. That's okay! If something doesn't Just Work - follow the framework above to get help. 

## Make it better

If you run into something you found that is confusing or needs fixing, we expect you to update the docs at minimum, and if you're keen then definitely improve the experience yourself. For example, CI is _everyone's_ job. If it sucks, fix it.

## Don't wait for someone else

We expect you to be proactive about answering questions you don't know the answer to. Find the answer. Being wrong is way better than being silent - if you are wrong, someone will correct you. If you are silent, you're not doing your job.

## Have an opinion

You definitely don't need to have opinions on everything - but you should absolutely have opinions on your area of expertise. If you don't have opinions on your area, you are realistically then just waiting for someone to tell you what to do, which is very much at odds with our atonomous way of working. Opinions can take a bit to form, and that's okay - you don't need to have them on day 1. But we expect you to start forming them rather early on, even if it's just on little things.

## Look around corners

We expect you to be thinking through not only the one change you are making right now, but also how that change plays out down the road. What might happen with this code / process / thing in 6 months? Where will that leave my change today? We do have more senior people on the team (both in industry experience and in their tenure at PostHog), but they shouldn't be the only ones looking ahead - you should be the primary one looking ahead for _your_ changes.
